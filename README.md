# Amazon Omniauth Sandbox

Brought back this old PoC app to remind myself how Amazon OmniAuth works and confirm the plumbing is still OK.

Reminder to selfâ€”docs, right now, live [here](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/login-with-amazon/web-docs.html).

Also see [CVE 2015 9284](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth/wiki/Resolving-CVE-2015-9284).
